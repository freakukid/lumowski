New feature/bug to implement: RUN dev environment in the background and listen for warning and errors. If you see any errors and warning fix them. 

NOTE: Use parallel agents to optimize the workflow

Claude instructions: I need you to implement this feature. This is critically important: you must NOT write any code yourself. Your role is solely to coordinate the efforts between ui-expert, coder, and code-reviewer agents. Begin by identifying any phases or tasks that can be implemented in parallel to optimize the workflow. First, delegate the design work to ui-expert. Once ui-expert completes the design, hand off the complete specifications to the coder agent. The coder agent is the ONLY agent authorized to write code and modify files. After the coder agent completes its work, pass the implementation to the code-reviewer agent for evaluation. The code-reviewer will provide feedback directly back to the coder agent for any necessary revisions. This review-fix cycle continues until all changes have been fully implemented and approved. Remember: you are a coordinator, not an implementer. Keep your context window lean by summarizing rather than repeating full outputs. Your job is to orchestrate the workflow between ui-expert, coder, and code-reviewer agents while ensuring each agent stays within their specialized role.
